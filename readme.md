# 1. Timer Notes:

Timer works as follows: Enter a total **number of seconds** into the input field which will then be converted to hours, minutes and seconds.
Once **Start Countdown** is clicked, the timer will countdown accordingly.

### A. Questions:
The prompt called for a "function prop that will format the time it displays".
Aside from the formatting I am doing in this one component, I would have asked for a little clarification on this being we are not passing properties around yet.
If it was a matter of passing a formatting function as a property down to a child component, then I could easily refactor to do so.
